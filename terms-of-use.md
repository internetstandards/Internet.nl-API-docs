# Terms of use Internet.nl API and Dashboard

Version 2023022301

By using an Internet.nl API / Dashboard account, you agree to being bound by the following terms of use.

## Definitions
* **Service**: the _Batch testing HTTP API_ (batch.internet.nl) and the related _Internet.nl Dashboard_ (dashboard.internet.nl).

## Terms
* The Dutch Internet Standards Platform delivers the Service on a 'best effort' basis without any guarantees regarding performance or availability. 
* The Service is build and optimized for testing a large number of domains with a single batch request. It is not allowed to use the Service for testing a single domain per request.
* It is not allowed to use the Batch testing HTTP API for offering public and/or commercial services using a third party (not being the Dutch Internet Standards Platform) front-end.
* Causing heavy loads for the Service makes things slower for other users. We therefore request the users to honor the following ‘fair use’ rules: 
  * Maximum 2 batch requests per week;
  * Per batch request a maximum of 5000 domain names;
* Each account is linked to a single contact person. This person is responsible for the account. 
  * Communication about changes or updates to the API and/or Dashboard is send to the contact person’s e-mail address.
  * If the contact person cannot be reached via the given e-mail address, the account will be deleted.
  * Accounts that have not been used for longer than 12 months will be deleted. 
* Per organization a maximum of 3 accounts will be provided.
* The Dutch Internet Standards Platform can unilateral decide to withdraw API access. For example in case of unauthorized use of misuse.
