# Terms of use Internet.nl API and Dashboard

Version 20250118

By using an Internet.nl API / Dashboard account, you agree to being bound by the following terms of use.

## Definitions
* **Service**: the _Batch testing HTTP API_ (batch.internet.nl) and the related _Internet.nl Dashboard_ (dashboard.internet.nl).

## Terms
1. The Dutch Internet Standards Platform delivers the Service on a 'best effort' basis without any guarantees regarding performance or availability. 
2. The Service is not a monitoring tool. It is a compliance test. 
3. The Service is build and optimized for testing a large number of domains with a single batch request. It is not allowed to use the Service for testing a single domain per request.
4. It is not allowed to use the Batch testing HTTP API for offering public and/or commercial services using a third party (not being the Dutch Internet Standards Platform) front-end.
5. Causing heavy loads for the Service makes things slower for other users. We therefore request the users to honor the following ‘fair use’ rules: 
  * Maximum 2 batch requests per week;
  * Per batch request a maximum of 5000 domain names;
6. Each account is linked to a single contact person: the account owner. The owner is responsible for the account. 
  * Communication about changes or updates to the API and/or Dashboard is send to the owner’s e-mail address.
  * If the owner cannot be reached via the given e-mail address, the account will be deleted.
  * Accounts that have not been used for longer than 12 months will be deleted. 
7. Per organization a maximum of 3 accounts will be provided.
8. It is not allowed to share an account with people not part of the organization of the owner.
9. The Dutch Internet Standards Platform can unilateral decide to withdraw API access. For example in case of unauthorized use of misuse.
10. Users will honor instructions of the Dutch Internet Standards Platform related to the usage of the Service.
