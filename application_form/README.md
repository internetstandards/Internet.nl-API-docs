We have an API that can be used for bulk requests. However, our is API is currently exclusively available for our platform members, non-profit organizations, and member of DDMA (https://ddma.nl/), ISPConnect (https://ispconnect.nl/) and VvR (https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/). Therefore I cannot provide access at this moment. I will write down your contact details so I can inform you in case our Steering Committee decides to make our API available for a wider public.
