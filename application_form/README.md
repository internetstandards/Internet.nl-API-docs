# API & Dashboard Access

We have an API (and the Dashboard for less technical users) that can be used for bulk requests. However, our is API is currently exclusively available for our platform members, non-profit organizations, and member of DHPA (https://www.dhpa.nl/), ISPConnect (https://ispconnect.nl/) and VvR (https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/). Therefore I cannot provide access at this moment. I will write down your contact details so I can inform you in case our Steering Committee decides to make our API available for a wider public.
