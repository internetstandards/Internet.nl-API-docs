# API & Dashboard Access

We have an API (and related Dashboard for less technical users) that can be used for batch requests. Users are expected to comply with the [terms of use](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl-API-docs/blob/main/terms-of-use.md). 

Our API is currently exclusively available for:
* our platform members;
* non-profit organizations (e.g. governments, public universities, and foundations);
* members of [Dutch Cloud Community](https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/);
* members of [Vereniging van Registrars](https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/);
* organizations that operate in "sectors of high criticality" according to the [NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). In the Netherlands also known as "category A vital infrastructure" as mentioned by [NCTV](https://www.nctv.nl/onderwerpen/vitale-infrastructuur/overzicht-vitale-processen).

Only if you meet one of these requirements API and Dashboard access can be provided. Fill in the application form and send a copy to [question@internet.nl](mailto:question@internet.nl).  

**Notice**: per organization a maximum of 3 accounts will be provided. 

**Don't meet the requirements?**
* Send your contact details (name, organization, e-mail address) to question@internet.nl to make sure you get notified when our Steering Committee decides to make our API available to a wider public.
* Create your own instance of Internet.nl. All of our products are open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/internetstandards).
