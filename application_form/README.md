# API & Dashboard Access

We have an API (and related dashboard for less technical users) that can be used for bulk requests. However, our is API is currently exclusively available for our platform members, non-profit organizations, members of the Dutch Cloud Community (https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/), and Vereniging van Registrars (https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/). Only if you meet one of these requirements API and Dashboard access can be provided.

Don't meet the requirements?
* Send your contact details (name, organization, e-mail address) to question@internet.nl to make sure you get notified when our Steering Committee decides to make our API available to a wider public.
* Create your own instance of Internet.nl. All of our products are open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/internetstandards)
