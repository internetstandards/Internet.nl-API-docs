# API & Dashboard Access

We have an API (and related Dashboard for less technical users) that can be used for batch requests. Users are expected to comply with the [terms of use](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl-API-docs/blob/main/terms-of-use.md). 

Our API is currently exclusively available for:
* our platform members.
* non-profit organizations (governments).
* members of Dutch Cloud Community (https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/).
* members of Vereniging van Registrars (https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/).

Only if you meet one of these requirements API and Dashboard access can be provided. Fill in the application form and send a copy to [question@internet.nl](mailto:question@internet.nl). 

**Don't meet the requirements?**
* Send your contact details (name, organization, e-mail address) to question@internet.nl to make sure you get notified when our Steering Committee decides to make our API available to a wider public.
* Create your own instance of Internet.nl. All of our products are open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/internetstandards).
