# API & Dashboard Access

We have an API (and related Dashboard for less technical users) that can be used for batch requests. Users are expected to comply with the [terms of use](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl-API-docs/blob/main/terms-of-use.md). 

Our API is currently exclusively available for:
1. our platform members;
2. non-profit organizations (e.g. governments, educational institutions, healtcare providers, associations, foundations);
3. members of [Dutch Cloud Community](https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/);
4. members of [Vereniging van Registrars](https://www.verenigingvanregistrars.nl/);
5. organizations that operate in "sectors of high criticality" according to the [NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). In the Netherlands also known as "category A vital infrastructure" as mentioned by [NCTV](https://www.nctv.nl/onderwerpen/vitale-infrastructuur/overzicht-vitale-processen);
6. hosters listed in our [Hall of Fame for hosters](https://en.internet.nl/halloffame/hosters/);
7. for-profit organizations that offer services to (a substantial amount of) non-profit organizations (2) or to organizations in sectors of high criticality (5).

Only if you meet one of these requirements API and Dashboard access can be provided. Please use our [online application form](https://dashboard.internet.nl/#/signup).  

**Notice**: per organization a maximum of 3 accounts will be provided.
